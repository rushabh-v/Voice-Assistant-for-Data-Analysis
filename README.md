# Voice-Assistant-for-Data-Analysis
Run SQL queries on a Database by speaking questions in Natural Language.

I have created a [redash](https://redash.io/) integration of this project where you can run queries by giving voice commands in natural language on the redash' web server. It will be released soon.

**This project uses [SQLOVA](https://github.com/naver/sqlova) algorithm.**
